# Customer Preference Centre
Customer Preference Centre example


## Input 
The program accepts user choices in form of an input text file like this

Each row represents choice of a particular user. For example the first row represents the choice of user A; which is Everyday. 
Last row represents the choice of the user C. 

This string representation is parsed to the following type

```fs
    /// <summary>
    /// Represents user's choice
    /// </summary>
    type UserChoice =
        | Never
        | Everyday
        | Day of int
        | DaysOfWeek of System.DayOfWeek array
```
### Specialities
The program is capable of handling slightly corrupted input files with the following cases. 
* When the input has duplicate days in the row 
* When the input has spaces and mixed names (some long, some short) for days 

## Project structure
There are three projects in solution. 

| Project | Purpose 
|---------|--------
| **`CustomPrefCentreLib`** | Holds core functionalities to implement the Customer Preference Centre
| **`CustomPrefCentre`** | F# Console Application to test the given sample case or any other (see sample run below)
| **`CustomPrefCentreLibTests`** | Expecto tests 

## Sample Run 
To run the program, select `CustomPrefCentre` as the start up project. Here is a sample run for the example scenario for 13 days.

## Unit tests 
To run the unit tests select `CustomPrefCentreLibTests` as the startup project. 
[Expecto](https://github.com/haf/expecto) is used to create the unit tests. The following screenshot shows tests ran and passed

There are two `testList`s. 

* One for Report Generation tests (These are rather integration tests)
* One for User Choice Parsing tests (Unit tests)

## Algorithm 
The program first loads the choices, then flattens them out to create an index with the day and the Day of Week. Later these two lists are concatenated to get the list of customer names.
